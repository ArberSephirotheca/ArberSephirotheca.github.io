Work & Research experience
======
* Summer 2025: Research Intern
  * Applied SIMT-Step semantics to shader development, focusing on warp execution correctness in HLSL.
  * Built a Clang-ASTâ€“based interpreter and fuzzing framework for HLSL to automatically generate warp execution tests.
  * Implemented a reducer to minimize failing tests into conformance test suites, enabling systematic validation across GPU vendors.
  * Identified and reported warp execution bugs under non-uniform control flow across NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD GPUs.
* Winter 2024: Research Assistant
  * University of California, Santa Cruz
  * Duties included: Developed a formal specification framework using TLA+, under the supervision of Professor Tyler Sorensen, to verify and analyze various GPU forward progress models.
  * Supervisor: Tyler Sorensen

* Fall 2024: Software Engineer Intern
  * Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America
  * Duties includes: Autonomous Driving - Middleware
