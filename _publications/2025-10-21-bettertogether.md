# permalink: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03883
excerpt: 'Data processing on the edge offers advantages over cloud-based solutions, including reduced latency and lower energy consumption.However, to fully utilize edge SoCs, applications must be efficiently mapped onto these devices constituent heterogeneous processing units. We demonstrate the portability of BetterTogether by evaluating it on three SoCs with GPUs from different vendors (NVIDIA, Arm, and Qualcomm) and using three computer vision edge workloads with different computational characteristics.'
